## Abstract

This project will analyze data from the Portuguese schools, Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira, to determine which factors most strongly influence students' academic performance in mathematics. By comparing demographic variables, such as parent education level and quality of family relationships, with academic variables, such as number of past class failures and extra paid classes, the research will seek to identify key predictors of student success.

## Introduction

In the early 2000s, Portugal's education was falling behind the rest of Europe, evidenced by its high student failure rates. In April 2008, Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva published a study analyzing student achievement in the secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data were collected through school reports and questionnaires that included information such as students' age, sex, address, job, and health. Though no ethical concerns are explicitly stated in the dataset, some variables are personal identifiers that could be used to trace back to specific people. For instance, parental status, age, sex, and home type could potentially reveal individuals’ identities. The data are currently publicly stored in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository [see @cortezSilva2008]. To better understand what contributed to Portugal's shortcomings in education, the following research seeks to understand which demographic and academic factors most correlate with academic success.


## Data

In order to analyze which factors are most predictive of student success in Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira, the dataset edu_achievement, was used, which contains information on the students' background factors and academic performance. The outcome variable, G3, represents the students' final grade. 

Three predictors were explored: internet access, health status, and family relationshup strength. To visualize the relationship between internet access and G3, a bar graph was used to compare students with and without internet access. For health status, a scatter plot with a fitted linear regression line was used. Similarly, a scatter plot was also used for family relationship strength.
