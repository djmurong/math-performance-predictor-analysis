## Abstract

This project will analyze data from the Portuguese schools, Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira, to determine which factors most strongly influence students' academic performance in mathematics. By comparing demographic variables, such as parent education level and quality of family relationships, with academic variables, such as number of past class failures and extra paid classes, the research will seek to identify key predictors of student success. It was found that internet access and interest in higher education were the largest indicators of success.

## Introduction

In the early 2000s, Portugal's education was falling behind the rest of Europe, evidenced by its high student failure rates. In April 2008, Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva published a study analyzing student achievement in the secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data were collected through school reports and questionnaires that included information such as students' age, sex, address, job, and health. Though no ethical concerns are explicitly stated in the dataset, some variables are personal identifiers that could be used to trace back to specific people. For instance, parental status, age, sex, and home type could potentially reveal individuals’ identities. The data are currently publicly stored in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository [see @cortezSilva2008]. To better understand what contributed to Portugal's shortcomings in education, the following research seeks to understand which demographic and academic factors most correlate with academic success.


## Data

In order to analyze which factors are most predictive of student success in Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira, the dataset edu_achievement, was used, which contains information on the students' background factors and academic performance. The outcome variable, G3, represents the students' final grade. 

The following variables were explored: number of past class failures, alcohol consumption during weekdays and the weekend, study time, internet access, health status, family relationship strength, mother and father education level, extra paid classes, and free time. To visualize the relationship between internet access and G3, a bar graph was used to compare students with and without internet access. For health status, a scatter plot with a fitted linear regression line was used. Similarly, a scatter plot was also used for family relationship strength. 



## Analysis

 Students with internet access had a higher mean final grade (10.6) and median grade (11) than those without access (mean = 9.41, median = 10), suggesting that access to online resources may improve academic performance, by increasing accessibility to resources and supplemental practice.

For health status, the mean final grade slightly increased from 10.0 at health = 3 to 10.4 at health = 5. Similarly, the median indicated that students who reported better health tended to perform slightly better academically. A linear regression confirmed a weak but positive association between health and final grades.

Gor family relationship strength (famrel), mean grades ranged from 9.89 to 10.8, and median grades stayed around 10–11. This consistency suggests that while positive family relationships may contribute to emotional support, they do not strongly predict differences in final academic performance. 

## Discussion

Conclusions:
Limitations:
- The data we analyzed were limited to math performance and only secondary education of two Portuguese schools. This reduces the generalizability of our conclusions.
- Weren't able to fully explore the interaction of variables.
- Weren't able to deeply analyze why certain variables have an influence on math performance.
