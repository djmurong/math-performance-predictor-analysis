An interesting observation from the side-by-side jitterplots is that there seems to be a pattern of two clusters: a large, arguably primary, cluster with data points with higher final grades and a smaller cluster around a final grade of 0. This observed pattern mirrors the potential outliers highlighted in the histogram in Figure 1. The gap between the two clusters in each distribution is substantial, especially for the one with students having 0 past class failures. Perhaps there is another variable that could explain this pattern. Nevertheless, it seems that the number of past class failures is a moderately strong indicator of math performance.\n\nnew_labels &lt;- c(\"Dalc\" = \"Weekday\", \"Walc\" = \"Weekend\")\n\nedu_achievement_longer |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    alc_type = fct_relevel(alc_type, c(\"Dalc\", \"Walc\")),\n    alc_lvl = fct_relevel(as.character(alc_lvl))\n  ) |&gt;\nggplot(aes(x = alc_lvl, y = G3, group = alc_lvl, color = alc_lvl)) +\n  geom_jitter(\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  geom_boxplot(\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    lwd = 1\n  ) +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(alc_type), labeller = labeller(.rows = new_labels)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Final Grade vs. Alcoholic Consumption Level\",\n    subtitle = \"Separated by Weekday and Weekend\",\n    x = \"Alcoholic Consumption Level\",\n    y = \"Final Grade\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n    \"1\" = \"red\",\n    \"2\" = \"yellow\",\n    \"3\" = \"orange\",\n    \"4\" = \"darkgoldenrod\",\n    \"5\" = \"brown\")\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedu_achievement_longer |&gt;\n  group_by(alc_type, alc_lvl) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    median = median(G3),\n    mean = mean(G3)\n  )\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'alc_type'.

However, the variability in final grades seems to decrease as alcohol consumption during weekdays increases. The variability seems to slightly decrease as alcohol consumption over the weekend increases, but it is much more subtle than that for changes in alcohol consumption during weekdays. Additionally, the variability is smaller for weekday alcohol consumption compared to weekend alcohol consumption in the levels 3-5. Again, we see the pattern of a large cluster of higher final grades and smaller cluster of lower final grades for the majority of the distributions here. Since there is not a change in the typical final grade as alcohol consumption of either form varies, alcohol consumption does not seem to have a strong influence, if at all, on math performance.\n\nnew_labels &lt;- c(\"&lt;2 hrs\", \"2-5 hrs\", \"5-10 hrs\", \"&gt;10 hrs\")\n\nedu_achievement |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    studytime = factor(studytime, labels = new_labels)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = studytime,\n      y = G3,\n      color = studytime\n    )\n  ) +\n    geom_jitter() +\n    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.4) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Final Grades vs. Study Time\",\n      x = \"Study Time (levels of hour ranges)\",\n      y = \"Final Grade\"\n    ) +\n    theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedu_achievement |&gt;\n  group_by(studytime) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    median = median(G3),\n    mean = mean(G3)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  studytime median  mean\n      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         1     10  10.0\n2         2     11  10.2\n3         3     12  11.4\n4         4     12  11.3\n\nedu_achievement |&gt;\n  summarize(r = cor(studytime, G3))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n       r\n   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.0978\n\n\nAgain, we see the pattern of a large cluster of higher final grades and smaller cluster of lower final grades for the majority of the distributions here. The distributions of final grades across amount of study time have similar variability. Their shapes are slightly symmetric to left-skewed. However, there is a slight increase in the mean and median final grade as study time increases. Given that observation, there appears to be a weak influence of study time on final grades.\nggplot(edu_achievement, aes(x = Medu, y = G3, group = Medu, color = Medu)) + \n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Mother’s Education Level\",\n    y = \"Final Grade (1-20)\",\n    title = \"Final Grade of Students Based on Mother’s Education Level\",\n    subtitle = \"Student Performance in Math in the Portugueuse schools of \nGabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nggplot(edu_achievement, aes(x = Fedu, y = G3, group = Fedu, color = Fedu)) + \n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Father’s Education Level\",\n    y = \"Final Grade (1-20)\",\n    title = \"Final Grade of Students Based on Father’s Education Level\",\n    subtitle = \"Student Performance in Math in the Portugueuse schools of \nGabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedu and G3 correlation:\n\nedu_achievement |&gt;\n  summarize(r = cor(Medu, G3))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      r\n  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.217\n\n\nFedu and G3 correlation:\n\nedu_achievement |&gt;\n  summarize(r = cor(Fedu, G3))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      r\n  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.152\n\n\n\nggplot(edu_achievement, aes(x = internet, y = G3, fill = internet)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Final Grades (G3) by Internet Access\",\n    x = \"Internet Access\",\n    y = \"Final Grade (G3)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nedu_achievement |&gt;\n  group_by(internet) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    median = median(G3, na.rm = TRUE),\n    mean = mean(G3, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  internet median  mean\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 no           10  9.41\n2 yes          11 10.6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with internet access had slightly higher average and median final grades.This suggests that internet access may provide academic advantages — possibly through easier access to online learning materials, homework help, or communication with teachers.\n\nggplot(edu_achievement, aes(x = factor(health), y = G3, fill = factor(health))) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Final Grades by Health Status\",\n    x = \"Health (1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent)\",\n    y = \"Final Grade (G3)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedu_achievement |&gt;\n  group_by(health) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    median = median(G3, na.rm = TRUE),\n    mean = mean(G3, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  health median  mean\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      1     13  11.9\n2      2     10  10.2\n3      3     10  10.0\n4      4     10  10.1\n5      5     11  10.4\n\n\n\nedu_achievement |&gt;\n  summarize(r = cor(health, G3))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n        r\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.0613\n\n\nThere is a mild positive trend where students reporting better health (1–5 scale) tend to have slightly higher grades.

In addition, it focuses on the causation behind the delays/cancellations.\nWe believe that understanding the trends in the number of delays/cancellations and the most prominent causes of them will help airports reduce the number of cancellations by preparing for seasons with higher numbers of delays/cancellations and by targeting the most imperative causes.\nWe predict that delays/cancellations are greater around the winter months due to the weather, and around the holiday season due to the volume of travelers.\nThe categorical variables in our research question are the predictors of cancellations, such as weather and year/month. The numerical variables in our research question are the number of delays due to factors such as weather or security."

However, some ethical concerns to consider include that many of the variables contain personal information and there are personal identifiers that could be used to trace back to specific people. For instance, it collects information about where they live, parental status, age, sex, address, job, and where they live which could be used to deduce who the people are. Furthermore, correlational findings are not causal.

    "text": "Introduction\nIn the early 2000s, Portugal’s education system was falling behind the rest of Europe, evidenced by its high student failure rates (Cortez and Silva 2008). In April 2008, Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva published a study analyzing student achievement in the secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data were collected through school reports and questionnaires that included information such as student age, sex, address, job, and health. Though no ethical concerns are explicitly stated in the dataset, some variables are personal identifiers that could be used to trace back to specific people. For instance, parental status, age, sex, and home type could potentially reveal individuals’ identities. The data are currently publicly stored in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. To better understand what contributed to Portugal’s shortcomings in education, the following research seeks to understand which demographic and academic factors most correlate with academic success."

    "text": "Analysis\nFirst, we plotted a histogram of the counts of final grades to visualize a general distribution of final grades from the dataset, as shown in Figure 1. The histogram shows a slight right-skewed distribution with a large number of potential outliers, each with a final grade of 0. However, we speculate that these 0s are due to the high frequency of students dropping out of school, which leads to an incomplete final grade of 0. We decided not to remove the observations with final grades of 0 because of their prevalence and low chance of resulting from data collection errors, given that the information for all the variables was complete for those observations. Furthermore, we believed they could be meaningful when analyzing the influence of our target predictor variables. The center of the distribution is at a median of 11, which served as a baseline for our future plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing plots for each predictor variable, we observed that the following variables showed some correlation with final grade performance: interest in higher education, number of past class failures, study time, and parent education level.\nFigure 2 displays how the typical final grade, depicted as the median, decreases as the number of past class failures increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Differences in medians of students’ final grades across the number of past class fails they have.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 reveals a slight increase in the typical final grade as amount of study time increases, although not substantial enough to be among the strongest factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Differences in medians of final grade across study time\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 displays how there is a variable trend of student performance with regard to parent education level. The median final grade for students whose parent has no education is higher than the rest, but there are only a few points of data where parent education is none, making the pattern difficult to confirm. Nonetheless, the trend is not strong enough to be considered one of the strongest factors of student performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Differences in medians of students’ final grade with different parent education level.

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nOur analysis suggests that the strongest indicators of student success, as measured by final math grades, were interest in pursuing higher education and a low number of past class failures. Students who intended to continue their education beyond secondary school tended to achieve higher grades, possibly reflecting greater academic motivation and a higher level of long-term planning. On the other hand, students with a history of course failures tended to perform worse, which could indicate underlying struggles such as poor studying strategies or procrastination.\nInterestingly, some factors that might be presumed to have a strong effect on math performance, such as participation in paid extra classes and the amount of alcohol consumption, showed little to no correlation with final grades. These findings suggest that traditional methods for improving educational performance, such as supplementary instruction and alcohol awareness programs, may not apply to all educational contexts and that student motivation and performance history may be far more influential than access to additional academic resources alone. People should exercise caution when making presumptions about which factors most strongly influence academic achievement because they can be misguiding.\nThe results offer a number of applications for educators and policymakers. Attempts to boost interest in pursuing higher education could yield substantial improvements in student performance. Some examples include raising awareness of the benefits of continuing education, reorienting school curricula to encourage academic exploration and the discovery of academic passions, or rewarding academic achievement. Additionally, schools might consider developing support programs that target students with a history of class failures. These programs could, for instance, offer students accountability and help them build or regain confidence. By investing resources that address the strongest factors for educational performance, identified as interest in higher education and the number of past class failures, educational institutions can achieve the highest return on intervention measures.\nWhile our analysis provides meaningful insights, limitations naturally arise. The data we analyzed were limited to math performance among secondary students in two Portuguese schools during the 2005-2006 school year, which reduces the generalizability of our conclusions to other subjects, regions, and educational systems. Furthermore, the data were collected through self-reported questionnaires, which may not fully capture students’ true behaviors, attitudes, or study habits.\nThe final grade (G3) metric may not account for other important outcomes such as problem-solving or critical thinking skills. Additionally, our analysis did not fully consider the interactions between variables, such as how parental education and school support might jointly influence performance. Since our data are correlational, we cannot infer causation from our analysis. Branching off from that idea, our analysis did not examine whether interest in pursuing a higher education enhances academic performance or whether interest is a result of high academic performance."
